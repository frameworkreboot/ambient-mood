## Data Sources

Ambient Moods can generate experiences based on different data sources, which you can select using the tabs at the bottom of the screen:

### Time

The Time source uses the current time of day to generate moods and sounds:

- Morning hours create bright, positive emotions
- Midday is energetic and neutral
- Evening hours are more contemplative
- Night creates mysterious, deep moods

This mode requires no user input and continually changes based on the time.

### Weather

The Weather source uses real weather conditions to create experiences:

1. Enter a city name in the search field
2. Click "Search" or press Enter
3. Alternatively, click "Current Location" to use your device's location

Weather conditions affect the experience:
- Sunny weather creates bright, cheerful sounds
- Cloudy conditions are more neutral
- Rain creates darker, more contemplative moods
- Storms generate intense, dramatic experiences
- Snow creates soft, delicate patterns

### Manual

The Manual source gives you direct control over the emotional parameters:

- **Intensity**: How strong or prominent the effect is
- **Value**: The primary mapping value (affects colors and pitch)
- **Mood**: The emotional tone from negative to positive

Use the sliders to adjust these values in real-time and create your own custom moods.

## Understanding the Visualization

The visualization responds to both the data source and the audio:

- **Colors** change based on the emotional values
- **Patterns** move and pulse with the audio
- **Particles** react to beats and intensity
- **Waveforms** display the actual audio signal

The visualization is designed to enhance the audio experience with synchronized visuals that reflect the mood and character of the sound.

## Data Display

In the bottom-left corner of the visualization area, you'll see a display showing the current emotional parameters:

- **Intensity**: How strong the emotion is (0-1)
- **Value**: The primary value (0-100)
- **Mood**: The emotional spectrum (-10 to +10)

For weather data, you'll also see:
- **Location**: The current weather location
- **Conditions**: Weather description and temperature
